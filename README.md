# DemiRGB firmware

Note that this firmware is no longer being maintained.
It is recommended you instead take a look at [Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/), which supports a similar API as this firmware, but also includes a lot more support including MQTT.

The Tasmota device template for DemiRGB is:

```
{"NAME":"DemiRGB","GPIO":[0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,417,416,418,0,0,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":18}
```
